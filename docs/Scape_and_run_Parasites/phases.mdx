title: SRP Phases
hide_meta: true
---

There are 10 phases in Scape & Run Parasites, you can find what each phase does at the bottom of the page.

### How phases work
---

* They **DO NOT** depend on time, but rather obtaining **Points**.
* World generation can greatly impact how fast Phases progress. DOn't be suprised if they propser better in some worlds while in others they don't.
* Points are gained cumulatively; the point counter does not reset everytime the phase advances.
* **For 20 minutes after changing phases, parasites will not be able to gain nor lose points.**
* All dimesnions, other than the Overworld and Nether, start with -100 points in Phase -1 by default. The Overworld starts in Phase 0 with points, and the Nether starts in Phase -1 with -50 points.

### Obtaining Points
---

Parasites are able to obtain Points to advance into higher Evolution Phases, they can gain Points by completing certain Tasks, these being:
    1. Killing Mobs (1 Point each)
    2. Assimilating Mobs (6 Points each)
    3. Infesting blocks (6 Points each)
    4. Merging (9 Points each)
    5. Cysts consuming items (2 Points per item)
    6. Dispatcher Nidus failing to spawn a Stage 1 Dispatcher (120 Points each)
    7. If an Adapted Parasite that spawned from merging despawns (100 Points each)

Each time they gain enough Points to move to the next Phase the number in which the phase turned to will be sent in chat, accompanied by a unique sound.

### Point Cooldowns
---

There are *two* ways that a point cooldown happens:

    * **Using** Lures, a craftable block introduced by the mod, created with cobblestone and parasite drops that will put a point cooldown for a certain number of seconds, depending on the tier.
    * When a new phase happens, itll go on cooldown.

### Subtracting points
---

There are three ways that subtract points from a dimension

*Note that when the Phase decreases, all nearby Parasites will gain the Rage effect.*

    * **Using** Carcasses, a multi-block structure of Lures introduced by the Mod. When used, they lower points by a certain amount, depending on the Lure that was used. They are the only way to decrease Phases.
    * **Breaking** Infested Blocks, breaking Infested Blocks created by a Beckon will subtract points per block broken.
        * Infested Rubble types will subtract 4 points.
        * Infested Trunk types will subtract 3 points.
        * Infested Stain types will subtract 2 points.
    * Killing Parasites, when a Parasite is killed, it will subtract some points from the dimension. Killing parasites that have the Debar effect will not subtract any points. The exact amount of points subtracted varies per Tier. Values can be seen below:

### Measuring Phases
---

The Blody Clock is an Item Players can obtain very early in-game. It is used to check what Phase the Dimension is in, but cannot see the specific amount of points.

### Negative Evolution Phases
---

Negative Evolution Phases are Evolution Phases for Dimensions other than the Overworld, by default. It is used for disabling Parasites from spawning until a Parasite infiltrates the Dimension or to completely stop Parasites from gaining points.
