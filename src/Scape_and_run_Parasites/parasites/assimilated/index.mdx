Assimilated Mobs are the Assimilated variants of vanilla mobs, which have been overtaken by the infection through Call Of The Hive. These mobs are placed above Inborn Parasites. Assimilated Mobs' abilities and statistics are very diversified, though the majority of them pose no particularly high threat.

Killing any of them, or the heads that some can spawn upon death, grants the player the "Assimilated" advancement. The heads specifically also grant the "L Corp" advancement when slain.
