Inborn Parasites are a tier of Parasites that sits at the bottom of the parasite hierarchy. They are primarily responsible for propagating the infection. In a way, Inborn Parasites can be subdivided into the Rupter family, which initiates the infection and subsequently advances it, and Carriers, which directly promote its spread later on.
