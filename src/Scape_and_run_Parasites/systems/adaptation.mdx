## Mechanics

The Parasite in question must receive damage from a certain Damage Source that in order to adapt to it. Each item and entity count as an individual Damage Type. When a parasite is hit by a Damage Source it will gain one Adaptation Point for that Damage Type. Each Adaptation Point will reduce oncoming damage by a certain percentage, depending on that parasite's tier. Each tier also has its own Adaptation Point Cap and Adaptation Chance. Setting a parasite on fire adds an additional chance to fail adaptation depending on the tier. Parasites can adapt to ALL Damage Sources EXCEPT suffocation and being in the void. ~~Parasites can adapt to Fire Damage, but still receive its negative effects even if immune to its damage~~.

<u>**Logic**</u>
    * If the damage is coming from a Player, the Parasite will adapt to the Item that dealt the damage.
    * If the damage is coming from a Living Entity, the Parasite will adapt to the Entity that dealt the damage.
    * If the damage is not coming from a Living Entity, the Parasite will adapt to the Damage Type of the damage.
