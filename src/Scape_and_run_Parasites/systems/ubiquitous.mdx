> As parasites grow further, new systems begin to activate across the world. Higher development levels unlock mechanics such as coordinated behavior, merging, scent waves, structures and expanded spawning rules.

Ubiquitous Development is a System that slowly allows the parasites to grow stronger (unlocks Parasite Biome, Colony, Hives, Scent System, Nests etc.) the more it evolves. The level of Ubiquitous Development is affected by how many dimensions are infected and the Evolution Phases of said dimensions.

**The points are determined by the sum of phases in all dimensions** (ex the overworld is on phase 3 and nether is on phase 4, Ubiquitous Develop would be 3 + 4 which is 7) Ubiquit Development is seperated in 5 levels.
