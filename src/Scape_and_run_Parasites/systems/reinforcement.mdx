title: Reinforcement system
hide-meta: true

When a parasite is killed, there is a chance for it to call reinforcements, this means that a Beckon will spawn nearby and will help in the fight. The Beckon has different stages and that will tell how many and which parasites it will spawn. You can change the Beckon mob spawning in the configuration file

The beckons also have the ability to infest nearby blocks, infested blocks can damage all mobs other than the parasite faction, you can change values like "maximum block hardness to infest block", "light level to spread to other block" and more in the configuration file.
