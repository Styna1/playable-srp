The infected have the ability to learn from their battles and if the conditions are met, they will start to melt until they're some Moving Flesh.
If 2 of these things meet, they will fuse together and grow, if they get big enough they will spawn a primitive mob (with half his total health) (Infected Dorpa is the only one that will not melt).

Conditions for the infected to turn into Moving Flesh:

    * The first condition: the infected needs to reach the primitive killcount..
    * The second condition: it needs to be next to 3 more infected, regardless of their killcount/specie OR it needs to be next to a Moving Flesh.
    
If the infected with the killcount is next to atleast 3 more infected, the four of them will start to melt BUT if it is next to a Moving flesh, only it will start to melt.
