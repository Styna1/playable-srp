## Overview

Emerging Infection Vectors is a System which as the name suggests, handles the appearance of the Parasites infestation in the world. 
If the Meteor Infestation is enabled in the configuration at world creation, the first Emerging Infection Vector will spawn at the Meteor impact coordinates, 
otherwise it has a chance to be created every day in random coordinates, with an added chance of spawning if there are no other Vectors in the world.

Parasites can only spawn if they're within the area of an Infection Vector, unless they are disabled. Each Infection Vector has health points, 
which increase if a parasite kills a mob or gets assimilated. Whenever either one of those happen, the total health the mob had is added to the Vector's own health, 
although the radius and health of the Infestation Vectors are able to increase independently each day or roughly 24000 ticks. 

The Infection Vectors passively and continuously generate points for the dimension they reside regardless of being loaded or not, 
taking into account their radius and health values.

To destroy an Infection Vector its health must reach 0, which can be attempted by killing parasites. Additionally, 
the Reinforcement System only works within the radius of Vectors.
