## Most common

> ### Why aren't any Parasites appearing?
Parasite spawning is dictated by <u>[Evolution Phases.](replaceme)</u> in the starting Phase, which is Phase 0 in the Overworld, only <u>[Buglins](replaceme2)</u> will spawn. 
As Parasites obtain more Points (which they get by killing and assimilating mobs, infesting blocks through Beckons, and [merging](replaceme3)) 
<u>[Evolution Phases](replaceme)</u> will go up, and the spawning will change and increase with them. Phases do not rely on days or time, only Points. Sometimes this may take awhile, depending on World Generation.

## Mod Related

> ### Is this mod available only on Forge?
Yes, specifically for Forge 1.12.2.

> ### When will the next update come out?
Be patient. Updates take a lot of time and effort, more than you think. This Mod has NOT been abandoned. There is no ETA, it'll be done when it is done.

## Game Related

> ### Why aren't Parasites gaining Points?
This is likely caused by the Point Gain Delay. For 20 minutes after reaching a new [Phase](replaceme), Parasites will not be able to gain Points. 
This can be circumvented with the command /time add 24000, or setting the Phase # Delay option in the config to 1. 
World Generation may massively speed up or hinder Point gaining. The presence of other Mods can massively effect Point gaining as well. 

> ### How can i reduce Points?
You can use Carcasses to reduce Points. See the [Lures](replaceme3) page on how to create a carcass in order to reduce points.
